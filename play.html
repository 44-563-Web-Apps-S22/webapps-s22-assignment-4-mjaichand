            <h6 class="dorimene name">DORIMENE:</h6> <p class="speech"> What? </p>
            <h6 class="monsieur_jourdain name">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> <p class="direction"> One step, if you please.</p>
            <h6 class="dorimene name">DORIMENE:</h6> <p class="speech"> What is it? </p>
            <h6 class="monsieur_jourdain name">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> <p class="direction"> Step back a little for the third. </p>
            <h6 class="dorante name">DORANTE:</h6> <p class="speech"> Madame, Monsieur Jourdain is very knowledgeable. </p>
            <h6 class="monsieur_jourdain name">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> <p class="speech"> Madame, it is a very great honor to me to be fortunate enough to be so happy as to have the joy that you should have had the goodness to accord me the graciousness of doing me the honor of honoring me with the favor of your presence; and, if Ialso had the merit to merit a merit such as yours, and if Heaven... envious of my luck... should have accorded me... the advantage of seeing me worthy... of the... </p>
            <h6 class="dorante name">DORANTE:</h6> <p class="speech"> Monsieur Jourdain, that is enough. Madame doesn't like grand compliments, and she knows that you are a man of wit. (Aside to Dorimene) As you can see, this good bourgeois is ridiculous enough in all his manners.</p>

            <h6 class="dorimene name">DORIMENE:</h6> <p class="speech"> I have great esteem for him.</p>
            <h6 class="monsieur_jourdain name">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> <p class="speech"> I have done nothing yet, Madame, to merit this favor.</p>
            <h6 class="dorante name">DORANTE:</h6> <p class="speech"> (Aside to Monsieur Jourdain) Take care, nonetheless, to say absolutely nothing to her about the diamond that you gave her.</p>
